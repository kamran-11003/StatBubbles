# Sample Data Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the temporary implementation of sample data used during API rate limit periods and the necessary cleanup steps for returning to live API data.

## TypeScript Configuration
### 1. Configuration Files Added
- `tsconfig.json`: Main TypeScript configuration
  - Configured for React JSX
  - Node-based module resolution
  - Support for .js and .jsx files
  - Proper source file pattern matching

- `tsconfig.node.json`: Node-specific configuration
  - Vite configuration support
  - ESM module handling
  - Development dependencies setup

### 2. Development Dependencies
Required TypeScript-related packages:
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "latest",
    "@types/react": "latest",
    "@types/react-dom": "latest"
  }
}
```

## Sample Data Files Created
1. `/src/data/samplePlayers.js`
   - Contains static player data for testing and development
   - Can be safely removed once API access is restored

2. `/src/utils/sampleDataHandler.js`
   - Handles fallback logic for sample data
   - Temporary utility for managing sample data state

## Modified Files
The following files were modified to accommodate sample data and need cleanup:

### 1. Player Model Changes
**File:** `/Frontend/src/components/PlayerModel.jsx`
- Added Fanatics advertisement section
- Implemented responsive image handling
- Added dark mode support
- **Cleanup needed:**
  - Remove advertisement section if not needed
  - Remove Fanatics image imports
  - Remove dark mode toggle for ads

### 2. Player List Changes
**File:** `/Frontend/src/components/PlayerList.jsx`
- Added infinite marquee advertisement
- Implemented responsive design
- Added dark mode support
- **Cleanup needed:**
  - Remove marquee section if not needed
  - Remove Fanatics image references
  - Remove marquee-related styles

### 3. Style Changes
**File:** `/Frontend/src/styles/marquee.css`
- Added custom marquee animation
- Implemented hover effects
- **Cleanup needed:**
  - Remove file if marquee is not needed

## Assets Added
1. `/public/fanatics.jpeg`
   - Advertisement image for Fanatics
   - Used in both modal and marquee
   - Dimensions: 600px Ã— 100px (recommended)

## Environment Setup
1. MongoDB connection required for sample data storage
2. `.env` file needed with:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/sports_stats
   SPORTSDATAIO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Cleanup Steps
1. Once API access is restored:
   - Remove sample data files
   - Remove MongoDB fallback logic
   - Restore direct API calls
2. If keeping advertisement features:
   - Update image paths
   - Maintain dark mode support
   - Keep responsive design elements

## Best Practices
1. Keep API keys secure
2. Implement proper error handling for API limits
3. Maintain fallback mechanisms for data availability
4. Document all temporary implementations

## Notes
- Keep MongoDB integration for caching if beneficial
- Consider implementing proper caching strategy
- Document any remaining rate limit handling procedures
